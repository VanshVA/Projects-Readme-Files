# College Coding Competition Web App

## Problem Statement

1. **User Roles and Functionality**:
   - Create a web application with distinct user roles: students, teachers, and admins.
   - Each role has specific functionalities: 
     - Students: Join competitions and edit profiles.
     - Teachers: Create competitions and check results.
     - Admins: Manage the application.

2. **Authentication and Authorization**:
   - Implement a secure authentication system using JWT.
   - Set up role-based access control to ensure that each user can only access their designated functionalities.

3. **Responsive and User-Friendly UI**:
   - Develop a responsive front-end using React.
   - Ensure a seamless user experience across all devices.

4. **Scalable Back-End**:
   - Build a scalable back-end using Node.js and Express.
   - Use MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.

5. **Deployment and Maintenance**:
   - Deploy the web application on a cloud platform such as AWS or Heroku.
   - Ensure continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) for regular updates and maintenance.

## Roadmap

1. **Planning**
   - Define user roles and their respective functionalities.
   - Design database schema.
   - Create system design and data flow diagrams.

2. **Setup**
   - Set up the development environment.
   - Initialize a new MERN stack project.

3. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Implement user authentication (JWT).
   - Set up role-based access control (RBAC).

4. **Front-End Development**
   - Build reusable components using React.
   - Implement routing using React Router.
   - Develop pages and dashboards for different user roles.

5. **Back-End Development**
   - Set up Express server.
   - Create RESTful APIs for user roles and competition functionalities.
   - Implement data models with Mongoose.

6. **Testing**
   - Unit testing for front-end and back-end.
   - Integration testing.

7. **Deployment**
   - Choose a cloud platform.
   - Configure CI/CD pipelines.
   - Deploy the application.

8. **Maintenance**
   - Monitor application performance.
   - Implement regular updates and bug fixes.

2-Student Dashboard
  Student -> Join Competition -> Competition Service -> Update Competitions -> MongoDB
  Student -> Edit Profile -> User Service -> Update User Info -> MongoDB

3-Teacher Dashboard
  Teacher -> Create Competition -> Competition Service -> Add Competition -> MongoDB
  Teacher -> Check Results -> Competition Service -> Fetch Results -> MongoDB -> Client

4-Admin Dashboard
  Admin -> Manage App -> Various Services -> Update Info -> MongoDB

  
## Technical Stack

- **Front-End**: React, Redux (for state management), React Router (for routing)
- **Back-End**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Deployment**: AWS/Heroku, Docker (for containerization)

## Steps for Implementation

1. **Setup Project**
   - Initialize Git repository.
   - Setup React project with Create React App.
   - Setup Node.js and Express server.

2. **Implement Authentication**
   - Create login and registration forms in React.
   - Set up JWT authentication in Express.
   - Implement role-based access control.

3. **Develop Front-End Components**
   - Create reusable components (Navbar, Footer, Form components).
   - Build pages and dashboards based on user roles.

4. **Develop Back-End APIs**
   - Set up Express routes for user and competition functionalities.
   - Implement CRUD operations for competitions.
   - Set up Mongoose models and schemas.

5. **Connect Front-End with Back-End**
   - Use Axios or Fetch API to make HTTP requests from React to Express.
   - Handle authentication tokens in client-side.

6. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for React components and Express routes.
   - Perform integration tests.

7. **Deploy the Application**
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines.
   - Deploy the app to AWS/Heroku.
   - Monitor and maintain the application.

## Additional Considerations

- **Security**: Ensure secure handling of user data, use HTTPS.
- **Performance**: Optimize API calls, use pagination where necessary.
- **User Experience**: Focus on responsive design and usability.
